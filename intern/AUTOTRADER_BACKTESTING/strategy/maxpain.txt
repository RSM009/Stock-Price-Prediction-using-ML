The logic behind this calculation is to identify the strike 
price that would cause the most financial pain or loss for option buyers
based on the open interest data. By selecting the strike price with the highest 
sum of open interest values, the calculation aims to approximate the price 
at which the maximum number of options would expire out-of-the-money,
resulting in losses for option buyers.
